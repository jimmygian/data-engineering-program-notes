Question 5

What’s the difference between business requirements, stakeholder requirements, and system requirements as described in this week’s videos?

- [ ] Business requirements are defined by the company leadership team, stakeholder requirements are defined by individual contributors within the organization, and system requirements are defined by the data engineer.
- [ ] There are functional and nonfunctional business, stakeholder, and system requirements.
- [o] Business requirements define the high level goals of the business. Stakeholder requirements define the needs of the individuals within the organization to meet those business goals. System requirements define what a system needs to be able to do in order to meet business and stakeholder requirements.
- [ ] Business and stakeholder requirements are the same thing, you gather both of these in the first stage of any data engineering project. System requirements are what you define after collecting high level requirements.

- [o] The middle gray box (around ingestion, transformation, serving and storage) represents the stages that will be the focus of your work as a data engineer.
- [ ] Storage is part of all stages of the data engineering lifecycle.
- [o] The undercurrents are not stages of the lifecycle but rather represent aspects of data engineering that cut across the entire lifecycle.
- [ ] Analytics, machine learning, and reverse ETL represent the final stage of the data engineering lifecycle.

Question 9

Consider the following scenario:

You work as a data engineer at a financial institution. You were tasked with building a pipeline to serve data for the data science team of the “clients services” department. You learned that the data scientists are interested in predicting customer churn, or in other words, being able to predict whether a given customer is likely to stop doing business with the bank. You met with the data scientists who told you that they’d like you to provide them with historical information about active and inactive customers, such as their past transactions, credit information, and account information. The data scientists will then analyze this data and build a churn prediction model. You learned that the information requested by the data scientists exists in several databases maintained by software engineers from different bank departments.

Identify the upstream and downstream stakeholders.

- [ ] The downstream stakeholders are the software engineers that maintain the source databases and the upstream stakeholders are the data scientists of the “client services” department.

- [ ] The downstream stakeholders are both the data scientists and the software engineers that maintain the source databases. The upstream stakeholders are the bank clients.

- [o]  The upstream stakeholders are the software engineers that maintain the source databases and the downstream stakeholders are the data scientists of the “client services” department.

- [o] AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud and you are responsible for security in the cloud.

- [ ] AWS is responsible for security behind the scenes in cloud systems and you are responsible for the security of any public facing components of your systems.

- [ ] Depending on the resources and services you choose to build your systems, AWS will be responsible for the security of some of them and you will be responsible for the security of others.
