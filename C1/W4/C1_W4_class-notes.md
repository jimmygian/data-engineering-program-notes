Stakeholder Management and Gathering Requirements

**Week 1 recap**
In the first week of this course, we took a brief look at requirements gathering as it relates to your work as a data engineer. 
- We looked at how a conversation might go between you and a data scientist at your company about their needs for the analytics and machine learning projects they're working on. 
- You saw how a conversation like this could quickly reveal the need for you to talk to other stakeholders. In this case, the marketing team and software engineers. 
- We also took a look at a framework for thinking like a data engineer, where you first identify business goals and stakeholder needs, then define requirements for your system based on those needs, then choose tools and technologies that meet your requirements, and then finally build and deploy your system.

Now there is a lot packed into this little framework, and even when I add in the details of what occurs during each step, things like asking what action your stakeholders will take in the first step, translating stakeholder needs into system requirements in the second step, prototyping and testing in the third, or evolving your system in the last step. You can see that there are still many things that are either left unsaid or unwritten here.

**Weeks 2 & 3 recap**
Weeks 2 and 3 of this course were designed to fill in many of those details so that you can form a more complete mental model of the stream work, the field of data engineering, and what your role as a data engineer will look and feel like in practice. 

In Week 2, you looked at the **stages** and **undercurrents** of the data engineering life cycle. There, we focused not only on the **components** that make up your data systems, but also on the people involved, including **source system owners** and **downstream end users** that you'll work with. 

In Week 3, we took a deep dive into the **principles of good data architecture**, where you saw that things like **planning for failure** and **choosing common components** or elements of your system design that you should be thinking about right from the start.

Now you have all the pieces of that mental model that will be critical in your work as a data engineer. This week, we're going to pull all those pieces together in the context of a **practical on-the-job scenario**. 
- We'll start with requirements gathering, 
- then choosing tools and technologies, 
- and finally implementation of your system.

At the end of this week, you'll translate the requirements into an architecture design and then build your system on the AWS Cloud. Join me in the next video to get started.


## Requirements

First step of the Data Engineering framework is to "identify business goals & stakeholders you will serve".

At this point, I'd like you to start thinking about requirements as a hierarchy of needs.
